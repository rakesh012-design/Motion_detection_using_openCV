# Motion Detection Using OpenCV

## How it works??

The webcam continuously captures video frames.
Frames are converted to grayscale and blurred to reduce noise.
A reference frame is used to compare with the current frame.
The absolute difference between frames is calculated â†’ areas of change represent motion.
Thresholding and contour detection are applied to identify moving objects.
Motion areas are highlighted with bounding boxes on the video feed.

## Features
Real-time motion detection using a live webcam feed.
Bounding boxes drawn around moving objects.
Simple and lightweight implementation using OpenCV.

## Example Output
